// Tourism is a process tree: a root (tourism) declares the arrangement between a
// place and the people who come to look at it, four movement heads carry it (the
// marking, the seeking, the staging, the residue), and each leaf is one form.
// The canon owns the tree shape, so this loader pulls the composition chains from
// @chbrain/khai-arch rather than re-deriving them here.
//
// The four run in order for one visit and continuously across many, since each
// residue is the next visit's marking -- so a play composes the members it needs
// rather than stepping the tree.
