//
// Undertow reads the ground a persona feels from (F-persona): it wires the three engines
// that supply it (body, the set-point drifted out of range; temperament, the resting
// disposition arrived with; mood, the affective colour laid on every read) and reads them
// as one shape -- a ground continuously producing feeling with no label saying where it
// came from. Its three bridges are ordered by how easily the persona can locate the
// source: the demand, the set, and the tint twist.
