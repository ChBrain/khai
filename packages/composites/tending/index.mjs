// Tending reads what happens in a persona who meets another's need (F-persona): it wires
// the two engines that carry it (compassion, the other-focused state and the responses
// that shadow it; caregiving, the behavioural system that acts on a felt need and what
// running it costs) and reads them as one system met at two ends. Its three bridges sort
// the movement by where the relief is aimed: the turn (at the other), the flinch (at the
// persona's own state), and the toll twist, where the second turns out to be the same
// failure at a slower speed.
