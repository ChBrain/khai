// Entry point for the slack composite. Reads the declarative `khai` manifest from
// package.json (the single source of truth for how this composite wires) and composes
// the markdown ladder into a ready-to-use instruction set. The canon owns the tree
// shape, so this loader pulls the composition chains from @chbrain/khai-arch; each
// member validates against its own khai type.
//
// Slack reads the room a persona has before a shortfall starts doing their thinking
// (F-persona): it wires the three engines that carry it (scarcity, what a felt lack does
// to attention and capacity; decision, what then gets chosen; self-control, the live
// override that remains when there is no room to arrange things otherwise) and reads
// where the tax lands -- on precisely the two faculties needed to get out. Its three
// bridges run by what the shortfall takes: the tunnel, the tax, and the grip twist.
