// Entry point for the overriding composite. Reads the declarative `khai` manifest from
// package.json (the single source of truth for how this composite wires) and composes
// the markdown ladder into a ready-to-use instruction set. The canon owns the tree
// shape, so this loader pulls the composition chains from @chbrain/khai-arch; each
// member validates against its own khai type.
//
// Overriding reads what a practitioner does when a standardised instrument and their own
// judgement disagree (F-persona): it wires the instrument (measure, blind by construction
// to the residue) and the judgement (expertise, arriving already read and unable to audit
// itself). Its three bridges are the rule, the call, and the reckoning twist -- the
// exception is real and cannot be identified in advance.
//
// Both atoms are wired here for the first time in the canon, and both are very new. The
// pairing is deliberate rather than convenient: the measure engine's residue and the
// expertise engine's tacit movement are the same absence seen from two sides, and this
// composite is the argument between the two people standing on either side of it.
