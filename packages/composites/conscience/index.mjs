// the three moral-self engines (moral-identity, how central being moral is to the self;
// moral-conviction, the attitudes stamped as moral absolutes; moral-licensing, the
// running moral balance) and reads them as one self-government of conduct. Its three
// bridges are the parts of that government: the core, the mandate, and the ledger twist.
