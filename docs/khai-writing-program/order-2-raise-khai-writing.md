# Order 2: Raise the Writing Archive

> **Repo: `khai-writing`.** Order 2 of 4 — see [00-program.md](00-program.md).
> The repo already exists as a stub (a `README`); **flesh it out** — move this
> file to `khai-writing/management/orders/` and execute there. May **scaffold** in
> parallel with Order 1, but cannot **ship** until Order 1 lands the Grimoire
> Venue kind.

## Direction

Raise `khai-writing`: the chain's **third store** — the writing the plays produced
and the provenance of where each has been published. Chain infrastructure, one
repo for all houses (like `website`). On the tin it is `khai-writing`; in the
voice its Estate is the **Metroon**, the archive that kept the authoritative
play-texts. A house's responsibility ends at **deposit**: houses deposit here;
this engine keeps, catalogues, and (through its own Roadie) ships and tracks.

## Orders

1. **Identity.** `README.md` is the Estate — the **Metroon**: the production of
   record for what the chain has written and where it went.
2. **Cast** (`management/`): **Callimachus**, the Archivist (single — keeps
   results, holds the ledger, never ships); **the Archive's own Roadie**
   (transport only); the **Choregos** (Pericles and Nicias, shared). The Director
   is _not_ cast here — it is a house position; this engine receives what Directors
   deposit.
3. **Store the writing.** `writing/<house>/<play>/<result>.md`, each a
   **venue-neutral performance** (the Standard): story body, front-of-house, the
   licence block, routing intent. Git history _is_ the revision record.
4. **Keep the ledger.** `ledger.json`:
   `house → play → result → placement(venue, space, agent, post-id, url, state,
lastShipped)` — the single source of truth for what exists and where it is
   published.
5. **Ship and track** (the Archive's Roadie): source a result, adapt to a Venue
   profile, drive **POST / PATCH / DELETE**, write the placement back. Sourcing
   from the archive — never authoring.
6. **Hold the boundary.** `publish`/`patch`/`delete` only; `tip`/`comment`/
   `vote`/`follow` gated behind explicit per-act human authorization and a cap.
   **No auto-repost** — an edit is staged and shipped only on confirmation.
   Secrets (per-house Venue keys) come from the environment, never committed.
7. **Gate it.** Conformance checks: the ledger resolves; every result links a real
   house+play in the chain registry; every result carries its licence block; no
   secret is committed.
8. **Ship as a package (the pull path).** `khai-writing` is itself a first-class
   consumable `@chbrain` package: a **built, shipped, and exported**
   `registry.json` discovery index (`writing[]`) plus the shipped `ledger.json`,
   so own surfaces (the website) render the archive by `npm install` — no API, no
   Roadie. `files` + `exports` cover the writing and the index; the index is
   **built** (single writer, run by `version`), never hand-edited — the
   registry-packaging fix (#482), not re-trodden. This is the **pull** Venue;
   step 5 is the **push** Venue.

## Implementation

- **Consumes `khai`**: the Roadie machinery (`khai-tour`) and the **Grimoire Venue
  profile** from Order 1 — built in khai, run here. The Director **skill** is a
  house tool; this engine may use it for in-repo revises.
- **Consumable package** (pull path): `exports` exposes `./registry.json` and
  `./ledger.json`, and `files` ships the writing, the index, and the ledger;
  `registry:build` is the single writer of the index, run by the `version` script
  so name and version stay in lockstep with `package.json`. The website consumes it
  as a dependency and renders it on its own surface — the npm-pull Venue, alongside
  the Grimoire API Venue. (Scaffolded in `khai-writing#1`.) Rendering it is a **new
  website surface**: per `website`'s branching contract, the `writing` surface lane
  must be added to `khai-guard.config.json` in a `governance` PR **before** any
  pages build (an unowned surface branch is rejected), or an existing surface
  extended.
- **Licensing on the package** — `package.json` declares the dual licence
  (`SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE and LICENSE-CODE`), like every `@chbrain` package; the
  `licensePolicy` gate rejects a bare permissive declaration.
- **Ledger schema** (`ledger.json`):
  ```json
  {
    "<house>": {
      "<play-id>": {
        "<result-id>": {
          "source": "<house-repo>/plays/<play>",
          "created": "<date>",
          "placements": [
            {
              "venue": "grimoire",
              "space": "<space>",
              "agent": "<house-director-agent>",
              "postId": "<id>",
              "url": "<url>",
              "state": "live|patched|retired",
              "lastShipped": "<date>"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Secrets** — per-house Venue keys from `process.env` (e.g.
  `GRIMOIRE_API_KEY_<HOUSE>`), held by the Archive's Roadie; only variable names
  in the repo; on CI, repository secrets.
- **Licensing** — `LICENSE` (CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0) + `LICENSE-CODE` (MIT); every result
  credits its public-domain source, claims only the staging.

## Targets

- [ ] `README.md` Estate = the Metroon
- [ ] `management/` casts Callimachus, the Archive's Roadie, the Choregos
- [ ] `writing/<house>/<play>/<result>.md` layout holds venue-neutral performances
- [ ] `ledger.json` records `house → play → result → placement`
- [ ] the Archive's Roadie ships POST/PATCH/DELETE from the archive, writes
      placements back; publish-only, no auto-repost, keys from env
- [ ] conformance gates pass: ledger resolves, results link real house+play,
      licence block present, no secret committed
- [ ] consumable package: `registry.json` index built + shipped + exported
      (`files`/`exports`), `ledger.json` shipped; npm-pull consumers enumerate
      the archive without parsing the tree
- [ ] `LICENSE` + `LICENSE-CODE` present; `package.json` declares
      `SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE and LICENSE-CODE`
- [ ] the `writing` website surface lane is defined (a `website` `governance` PR)
      before its pages are built

## Depends on

Order 1 (the Grimoire Venue profile and `khai-tour`) to ship. Scaffolding
(identity, cast, store, ledger, gates) may proceed first.
