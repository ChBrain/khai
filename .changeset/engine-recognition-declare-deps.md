"@chbrain/khai-engine-recognition": patch
---

Declare the `@chbrain/khai-arch` runtime dependency that `index.mjs` imports (`compositionOrder`); it previously resolved only via workspace hoisting, so a standalone install failed to load. Also declare the `@chbrain/khai-tests` devDependency the suite imports and align vitest to `^4.1.9`.
